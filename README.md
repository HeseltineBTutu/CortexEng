## Overview
CortexEng is an intelligent recommendation engine that leverages machine learning and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations for users. The core goal of the project is to solve the problem of information overload by surfacing highly relevant content, products, or experiences tailored to individual preferences and behaviors.
By analyzing patterns in user interactions, such as ratings, views, or purchases, CortexEng can identify similarities between users and recommend items that align with their unique tastes. This approach not only helps users discover new and niche items they might have missed but also enhances their overall experience by presenting suggestions that resonate with their evolving interests.

## Features
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes advanced collaborative filtering algorithms to generate personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Surfacing Niche Items**: Goes beyond popular choices to uncover hidden gems and long-tail items that users might have missed.
- **Modular Design**: Easily swap data storage mechanisms or recommendation algorithms.
- **Adaptability**: Continuously learns and adapts to users' evolving preferences, ensuring relevant suggestions over time.
- **API Integration**: Simple REST API for seamless integration with client applications.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with cloud infrastructure.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Potential for dynamic updates with future API enhancements.
