## Overview
CortexEng is an intelligent recommendation engine that leverages machine learning and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations for users. The core goal of the project is to solve the problem of information overload by surfacing highly relevant content, products, or experiences tailored to individual preferences and behaviors.
By analyzing patterns in user interactions, such as ratings, views, or purchases, CortexEng can identify similarities between users and recommend items that align with their unique tastes. This approach not only helps users discover new and niche items they might have missed but also enhances their overall experience by presenting suggestions that resonate with their evolving interests.

## Features
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes advanced collaborative filtering algorithms to generate personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Surfacing Niche Items**: Goes beyond popular choices to uncover hidden gems and long-tail items that users might have missed.
- **Modular Design**: Easily swap data storage mechanisms or recommendation algorithms.
- **Adaptability**: Continuously learns and adapts to users' evolving preferences, ensuring relevant suggestions over time.
- **API Integration**: Simple REST API for seamless integration with client applications.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with cloud infrastructure.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Potential for dynamic updates with future API enhancements.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the CortexEng recommendation system on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- PostgreSQL (for future enhancements)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CortexEng.git
    cd CortexEng
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary configuration variables.
    ```sh
    FLASK_APP=app.py
    FLASK_ENV=development
    API_KEY=your_api_key_here
5. **Run the Application**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

### Architecture
   CortexEng follows a modular architecture, consisting of the following components:
   - API: A RESTful API built with Flask for handling client requests and serving recommendations.
   - Recommendation Engine: The core component responsible for generating personalized recommendations using collaborative filtering algorithms.
   - Data Storage: A flexible storage solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing user interactions and item metadata.
   - Evaluation Module: A module for evaluating the performance of the recommendation algorithms and guiding continuous improvement.
     For more information, check out the Architecture Documentation.
### Technologies
   CortexEng is built using the following technologies:
   - Python: The primary programming language, chosen for its rich data science ecosystem and ease of prototyping.
   - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn: Essential libraries for numerical computations, data manipulation, and machine learning algorithms.
   - Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the RESTful API.
   - PostgreSQL (or MongoDB): A reliable relational (or document-based) database for storing user interactions and item metadata.
   - AWS (or other cloud platform): Cloud infrastructure for scalability and potential integration with managed machine learning services.

### Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with the API using tools like `curl` or Postman.

**Example Request:**
```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/recommendations -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" -d '{"user_id": 12345}'
```
### API Endpoints
- Method: POST
- **Parameters:**
  - `user_id (required)`: The unique identifier for the user.
  - `num_recommendations (optional)`: The number of recommendations to return (default: 10).
- **Description:** Returns a list of recommended item IDs for the given user.
### Potential Future Endpoints
- `/add_interaction`: For sending real-time user interaction data.
- `/items`: For retrieving a list of all available items with metadata.

### Testing
/items: For retrieving a list of all available items with metadata.
`pytest`

### Contributing
We welcome contributions! Follow the guidelines below to contribute to CortexEng.

### Coding Standards
- **Code Style:** Adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines for Python code.
- **Linting:** Use **`pycodestyle`** to check for style issues. Install it via pip:
  `pip install pycodestyle`
  - Run **`Pycodestyle`** on your code to ensure it meets the standards:
  `pycodestyle your_script.py`
- **Type Checking:** Use **`mypy`** for static type checking. Install it via pip:
  `pip install mypy`
Run **`mypy`** on your code to check for type errors:
 `mypy your_script.py`
### Module Documentation
- Docstrings: Use docstrings to document all modules, classes, methods, and functions. Follow the [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) conventions.
- Comments: Write clear and concise comments to explain non-obvious parts of the code.
### Example of a well-documented function:
`
def get_recommendations(user_id: int, num_recommendations: int = 10) -> List[int]:
    """
    Get a list of recommended item IDs for a given user.

    Args:
        user_id (int): The unique identifier for the user.
        num_recommendations (int, optional): The number of recommendations to return. Defaults to 10.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of recommended item IDs.
    """
